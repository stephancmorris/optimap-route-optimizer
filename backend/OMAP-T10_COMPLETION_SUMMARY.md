# OMAP-T10 - Implement Logging and Monitoring - COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Epic Link:** OMAP-E1 - Backend Optimization Service

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive structured logging and monitoring throughout the OptiMap backend service. The implementation provides visibility into all system operations, performance metrics, and error conditions with support for both development and production environments.

## Requirements Completed

### ✅ Step 1: Configure structured logging for FastAPI application

**Implementation:**
- Created centralized logging configuration module
- Implemented two formatters:
  - **ColoredFormatter**: Human-readable colored output for development
  - **StructuredFormatter**: JSON format for production log aggregation
- Configured console and optional file handlers
- Set appropriate log levels for third-party libraries

**Files Created:**
- `app/config/logging_config.py` - Complete logging configuration system with:
  - `StructuredFormatter` class for JSON output
  - `ColoredFormatter` class for colored console output
  - `setup_logging()` function for initialization
  - `get_logger()` helper function

**Features:**
- Automatic log level configuration via environment variables
- Support for both console and file logging
- JSON structured logging for production
- Colored output for development
- Proper timestamp formatting (ISO 8601)
- Source location tracking (file, line, function)

### ✅ Step 2: Log all incoming requests with timestamps

**Implementation:**
- Created dedicated logging middleware for HTTP request/response tracking
- Automatic request correlation using UUID request IDs
- Request duration tracking in milliseconds
- Client IP and endpoint logging
- Response status code logging
- Request ID included in response headers

**Files Created:**
- `app/middleware/logging_middleware.py` - Request logging middleware with:
  - `LoggingMiddleware` class for automatic HTTP logging
  - Request ID generation and correlation
  - Processing time measurement
  - Sensitive data sanitization
  - Helper functions for request/response body logging

- `app/middleware/__init__.py` - Middleware package initialization

**Logged Information:**
- Request ID (UUID for correlation)
- HTTP method and endpoint path
- Client IP address
- Query parameters
- Request timestamp
- Response status code
- Processing duration (milliseconds)

**Example Output:**
```
INFO | Incoming request: POST /optimize [request_id=abc-123, client_ip=172.18.0.1]
INFO | Request completed: POST /optimize - 200 (duration=3120ms) [request_id=abc-123]
```

### ✅ Step 3: Log optimization execution time and results

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced VRP solver with comprehensive execution logging
- Start/completion logging with full context
- Performance metrics tracking
- Success/failure indication with details

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/vrp_solver.py` - Added logging throughout solver execution:
  - Solver start with configuration details
  - Model initialization (DEBUG level)
  - Solver strategy (DEBUG level)
  - Completion with performance metrics
  - Failure cases with timeout information

**Logged Metrics:**
- Number of locations/stops
- Number of vehicles
- Depot index
- Time limit configuration
- Route length (result)
- Total distance (meters)
- Solve time (seconds)
- Success/failure indication

**Example Output:**
```
INFO | Starting VRP solver: 4 locations, 1 vehicle(s), depot=0, time_limit=30s
DEBUG | Creating routing index manager for 4 locations
DEBUG | Initializing routing model
DEBUG | Starting solver with strategy: PATH_CHEAPEST_ARC
INFO | VRP solver completed successfully: route_length=5, total_distance=8420m, solve_time=2.15s
```

### ✅ Step 4: Log external API calls and response times

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced OSRM client with detailed API call logging
- Request/response timing in milliseconds
- Success/failure logging with status codes
- Error handling with timing information
- Retry attempt logging (via existing tenacity integration)

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/osrm_client.py` - Added comprehensive API call logging:
  - API request initiation
  - Response time tracking
  - Success with status code and timing
  - Error cases with timing information
  - Distance matrix calculation summary

**Logged Information:**
- API URL being called
- Number of locations
- HTTP status code
- Response time (milliseconds)
- Matrix dimensions
- Success/failure indication
- Error details and types

**Example Output:**
```
INFO | Calculating distance matrix for 4 locations via OSRM
INFO | Requesting OSRM API: http://router.project-osrm.org/table/v1/driving/...
INFO | OSRM API request successful: status=200, response_time=1234ms
INFO | Successfully calculated 4x4 distance matrix: total_time=1250ms
```

**Error Output:**
```
ERROR | OSRM API timeout after 30000ms: Request timeout
ERROR | OSRM HTTP error: status=503, response_time=5000ms
ERROR | OSRM network error after 2000ms: Connection refused
```

### ✅ Step 5: Setup log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

**Implementation:**
- Configured all log levels throughout the application
- Proper log level usage for different scenarios
- Environment variable configuration
- Level-specific filtering for third-party libraries

**Files Modified:**
- `app/config/settings.py` - Added logging configuration:
  - `log_level`: Configurable log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  - `log_json_format`: Toggle between colored and JSON output
  - `log_file`: Optional file path for log output

- `app/main.py` - Integrated logging:
  - Initialize logging on startup
  - Log application configuration
  - Add logging middleware

**Log Level Usage:**

| Level | Usage | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **DEBUG** | Detailed diagnostic info | "Creating routing index manager", "Initializing routing model" |
| **INFO** | Normal operations | "Request completed", "VRP solver successful", "OSRM request successful" |
| **WARNING** | Unexpected but non-critical | "VRP solver failed to find solution", "Request took longer than expected" |
| **ERROR** | Operation failures | "OSRM API timeout", "Network error", "Solver error" |
| **CRITICAL** | System failures | "Failed to initialize application" |

```

### 2. Make a request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stops": [{"latitude": 40.7128, "longitude": -74.0060}, {"latitude": 40.7589, "longitude": -73.9851}], "depot_index": 0}'
```

### 3. Observe logs:
You should see detailed logging including:
- Request received with correlation ID
- OSRM API call with timing
- VRP solver execution with metrics
- Request completion with total duration

### 4. Test with DEBUG level:
```bash
# In .env file or environment
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Restart and observe more detailed logs
docker compose restart backend
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics Available
1. **Request metrics:** Rate, duration, status codes
2. **OSRM metrics:** Response times, timeout rate, error rate
3. **Solver metrics:** Execution time, success rate, failure reasons
4. **Business metrics:** Optimization savings, stops per request

### Log Analysis Tools
- **jq**: JSON log parsing
- **grep/awk**: Text log analysis
- **ELK Stack**: Production log aggregation
- **Grafana + Loki**: Visualization and alerting

### Example Queries
```bash
# Find slow requests
grep "duration_ms" app.log | awk -F'"duration_ms": ' '{if ($2 > 5000) print $0}'

# Count errors by type
grep "ERROR" app.log | grep -o 'app\.[^:]*' | sort | uniq -c

# Trace a specific request
grep "abc-123-def-456" app.log
```

## Benefits
